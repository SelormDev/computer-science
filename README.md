<!-- # OSSU Computer Science Journey -->

## üéØ What This Repository Is About

This repository is dedicated to tracking my journey through the [OSSU Computer Science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) curriculum. This curriculum is a complete path to obtaining a strong foundation in computer science, covering a wide range of topics from programming to systems, theory, and applications.

## üìö What I‚Äôm Doing

I am dedicated to self-paced learning, focusing on mastering the fundamentals of computer science. I will document my progress here, including:

- Notes and summaries of key concepts
- Code implementations and projects
- Solutions to problem sets
- Reflections and takeaways from each course

## üöÄ How This Repo Will Evolve

As I complete each course, I will:

- Upload notes and projects for each topic.
- Create a dedicated folder for each course, containing assignments, code files, and additional resources.
- Share my learnings and key takeaways in the form of blog posts or video tutorials.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue through the OSSU curriculum!
