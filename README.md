# OSSU Computer Science Journey

This repository is dedicated to tracking my journey through the [OSSU Computer Science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) curriculum. This curriculum is a complete path to obtaining a strong foundation in computer science, covering a wide range of topics from programming to systems, theory, and applications.

## üéØ What This Repository Is About
I am currently learning the fundamentals of computer science, following the OSSU curriculum which is based on top university courses. This repo serves as my progress tracker, including the courses I have completed and the ones I am currently studying. Additionally, it provides a record of notes, projects, and assignments I will work on as part of this curriculum.

## üìö What I‚Äôm Doing
I am dedicated to self-paced learning, focusing on mastering the fundamentals of computer science. I will document my progress here, including:
- Notes and summaries of key concepts
- Code implementations and projects
- Solutions to problem sets
- Reflections and takeaways from each course

## üöÄ How This Repo Will Evolve

As I complete each course, I will:
- Upload notes and projects for each topic.
- Create a dedicated folder for each course, containing assignments, code files, and additional resources.
- Share my learnings and key takeaways in the form of blog posts or video tutorials.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue through the OSSU curriculum!
